Strong correlation (r2=0.754) is confirmed between the latitude and the maximum temperature in the northern hemisphere. Lesser correlation, but still moderate in its sifnificance, is found in the southern hemisphere. In general, when we approach the equator, the temperature increases (and vice versa).
For both hemispheres, the r2-value is very close to zero when relating the latitude to the humidity. No correlation was confirmed.
Cloudiness does not correlate with the latitude. 
Wind speed does not reveal correlation with the latitude.

I had some issues in assigning the API keys, so I watched that part of the speed run. I also had some questions in the hvplot section and defining a linear regression plot function, so I partially used the speedrun video to accomplish this assignment.
